\section*{Single-factor ANOVA with two levels - equal variance at each level}
Data characteristics:
\par\vspace{0.4 cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data is classified by two levels of a single factor
\item Error variance is the same at both levels
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
getwd()

df = read.csv('single_factor_anova_two_levels.csv')

str(df)

y = df$y

lvl = as.factor(df$lvl)

@

Run the frequentist (classical) ANOVA:

<<>>=
aov1<-aov(y~lvl)                        #frequentist 1-way ANOVA
str(aov1)                               #display the output data structure
summary(aov1)                           #show ANOVA table
@

Boxplot of the raw data:
<<>>=
boxplot(y~lvl)
@

Boxplot of the fitted values:
<<>>=
boxplot(aov1$fitted.values ~ lvl)
@

Here are the estimated coefficients from the model.

Most ANOVA software does not display these unless you specifically request them.

Usually you only see the ANOVA summary table with the F tests.

<<>>=
print(aov1$coefficients)
@

How would you interpret these coefficients in terms of the weights of males and females?
